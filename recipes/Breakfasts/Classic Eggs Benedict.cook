In #1-quart saucepan{}, vigorously stir @egg yolks{3} and @lemon juice{1%tbsp} with wire whisk. Add 1/4 cup of the @butter{1/4%cup}. Heat over very low heat, stirring constantly with wire whisk, until butter is melted.

Add remaining 1/4 cup @butter{1/4%cup}. Continue stirring vigorously until butter is melted and sauce is thickened. (Be sure butter melts slowly so eggs have time to cook and thicken sauce without curdling.) If the sauce curdles (mixture begins to separate and melted butter starts to appear around the edge of the pan and on top of the sauce), add about 1 tablespoon boiling water and beat vigorously with wire whisk or egg beater until smooth. Keep warm.

Split English muffins; toast. Spread each muffin half with some of the 3 tablespoons butter; keep warm.

In 10-inch skillet, melt 1 teaspoon butter over medium heat. Cook bacon in butter until light brown on both sides; keep warm.

Wipe out skillet to clean; fill with 2 to 3 inches water. Add vinegar to water. Heat to boiling; reduce to simmering. Break cold eggs, one at a time, into custard cup or saucer. Holding dish close to waterâ€™s surface, carefully slip eggs into water. Cook 3 to 5 minutes or until whites and yolks are firm, not runny (water should be gently simmering and not boiling). Remove with slotted spoon.

Place 1 slice bacon on each muffin half. Top with egg. Spoon warm sauce over eggs. Sprinkle with paprika.
