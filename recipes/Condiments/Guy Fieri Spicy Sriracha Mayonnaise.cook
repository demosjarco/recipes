In a #mixing bowl{}, combine the @mayonnaise{1%cup}, @sour cream{1/2%cup}, @sriracha{1.5%tbsp}, @lemon juice{1%tsp}, @honey{1%tsp} and @finely chopped green onions{4}. Stir until well combined. Add @salt{} and @pepper{} to taste.

Let the sauce sit for at least ~{1%hour} in the refrigerator. This will allow all the flavors to meld. You can use it immediately, but the longer you let it sit in the refrigerator, the more flavorful it will be.
